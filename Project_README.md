# xMenu
Simplify the usage of **headless** Linux machines *(also works on Windows)*

**Project is in Alpha Version!**

| Version      | Description     | Release Date     |
| :-------- | :------- | :------- |
| `Pinapple` | `First dev version` | 'None' |
| `Blueb3rry.0.1.0-1` | `First release` | '06.June.2024' |

First Version of this idea: https://github.com/w0lfzk1n/EzPizMenu

![xMenu](./images/Main.PNG)

This project is a simple console that allows you to perform redunant actions on a headless *(console-only)* Linux server, *like a Raspberry Pi*.

At start, the project will import all nessecary Libraries *(python and custom)* into a Variable **MOD** and uses this in the Rest of the project, that means that the modules and script do not need imports.

Aswell, the Configuration files **configs/*.json** are imported into a Variable **CONFIG** and can be used troughout the project too.

All modules are called with **module(MOD, CONFIG, args)**.

It runs in a **python3 venv**, so the needed Libraries and installation will not mess up your machines setup of python <3

# Installation

*Install GIT first*

https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

**Linux**
```
git clone https://github.com/w0lfzk1n/xMenu
cd xMenu
bash start.sh install
```

**Windows**
```
git clone https://github.com/w0lfzk1n/xMenu
cd xMenu
bash start.bat install
```

*Run "setup" in the console on a fresh install, to setup the config*

After this, you can run
```bash start.sh start```
to start the project.

Alternatively you can add an Alias *on Linux*:

```
sudo nano /etc/bash.bashrc
```

Add at the end of the file:

```
alias xmenu="cd /path/to/your/xMenu && bash start.sh start"
```

Reboot and after your should be able to run the project with **xmenu** from the bash console.

A full documentation can be found below.

# Disclaimer

This is a *sandbox*. I used it to improve my knowledge of python and finally complete the idea I had 2 years ago.

This project is pretty solid, but there are tons of things that can be done different and better.

For example, you are able to save Password for SSH. These are encrypted before saving them, but this encryption is not very strong, it just prevents the password to be displayed in plain-text if someone checks the file without permission.

If you like this idea/project, feel free to rework some parts or share changes with me. *You can use Pull-Requests*
